Hey peoples,

Yea, I know I'm bad. I sent a mass email to a bunch of people I know. But, hopefully you will forgive me when you find out what this is about.

It's a little web service where you put in your schedule and it tells you who is in your classes based on what other people enter. Also, there should be a fix for MISchedule comming up here soon. It will be around before you have to register for the winter term if everything works out.


Features now availible:

-lists of people in depts, courses, and sections as well as all people in your classes (my schedule, then click on links in the table)
-copy and paste from wolverine access (import classes)


Also, features to come soon, but not yet availible:

-confirm link to email instead of random password
-"tell your friends" feature
-people lists improvement (what do you guys want in the list?)
-allow users to enter classes without a section number
-privacy settings
-more info about classes (days, times, instructors, etc.)
-create groups (alternative classes)
-link to thefacebook, or maybe just picture


Here's the address:

Please share it if you like the service.

Hello peoples,

This will be my last bulk email, to you, from me, about the Schedule Sharing Tool. Yes, I know, it's sad.

The reasons: 

1) There are many new features coming your way. 
The Schedule Sharing Tool keeps on getting better and better. I want to let people know about these new features and announcements, but I don't want to be rude and send bulk email to clutter your inbox.

2) I have set up a blog. 
If you want to keep up to date with the development, new features, bugs, etc., you can now read the blog:
http://www.livejournal.com/users/schedulesharing/

3) I will be soon setting up preferences so that you can opt-out of these and other emails from the Schedule Sharing Tool. So, I lied, this may not be my last email, but you will be able to opt-out of emails soon. I will not send another until I have this set up. Check the blog and website for more info.

4) The user base is getting larger. 
I may be accused of spamming, which I definitely don't want. By the way, you can help make our user base grow! Check out the "spread the word" function on the site.

Enjoy!

Dear MSA Execs,

I've just created a service that I think I lot of students will be interested in.

This is a FREE service that helps you to share your class schedule and find people in your classes. It also gives you a visual representation of your schedule. Wolverine Access does not offer ANY of this.

I'm wondering if you would like to sponsor it. Currently the address is http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mulka/schedule/ but I may need to move it to another server if it starts to get popular.

To: ScheduleChimp Feedback form (ScheduleChimp@umich.edu)

1. Do you like the aesthetic feel of the site?
It is very nice. Much better than my site.

2. Did the site seem to 'grades' schedules well?
Umm... I guess?

3. Do you like how it emulates Wolverine Access?
Well, considering they changed Wolverine Access, this question really doesn't apply. Wolverine Access now is really slow even at non-peak times. There are way to many pages to go through just to do a simple thing.

4. Would you like to see this as part of Wolverine
   Access, or should it be kept as a separate site?
   And what if we could rig up one-click registration?
This should deffinatly be a part of WA. I don't know why its not. One-click registration would be very handy.

5. Do you like the way the schedules are laid out?
   (as opposed to W.A.'s tabular method)
I like the classes layed out how I can see them. This is especially good for printing.

6. If I kept this site up and running, would you
   use it for future semesters?
If there was someway to integrate it with WA, yes. Currently your system does not provide me anyway of knowing what classes are still open, and how to register for them other than searching for that class at that time.

7. Was the site at all slow or sluggish?
Nope, not really.

8. If you have used Schedule Monkey, are there any
   features of that that you find missing here?
What's Schedule Monkey? Is it still around?

9. If you're in HKN, would you like to see the C.E.G.
   (Course Evaluation Guide) transformed into a
   Wolverine Access look-alike like this?
10.Feel free to mention anything else that might be
   of interest to us developers.
You know MISchedule.com right? They were on the right track with this sort of thing. I used that for a semester and I liked it. Too bad it doesn't work anymore. As a developer myself, I'm working on a fix for it. I'm also doing other things with schedules. Check it out:
http://umich.edu/~mulka/schedule/

I've already talked to Michael, but maybe there are more people on this team. You aren't still working on this project are you?

Hello!

I don't know if this is the right email to be sending this to, but here goes. 
I've been working on a database driven website hoping eventually that it will 
be embraced by UofM or just the students if not UofM itself. It allows students 
to basically post their schedule to the world if they want and see who else is 
in their classes. I'm also working on a feature that will compare several schedules 
so that you can see when everyone is free, for group meetings, practices, etc. 
I currently have over 100 users, and it seems to be working quite well. I'm 
wondering if CourseTools would be the place to put this kind of tool or if you 
are working on something like this already. Since I've spent a great deal of 
time working on this I'd like to get something out of it even if I can only get 
credit for it, although money would be nice. Let me know what you think about 
it and the possibility of incorporating this into CourseTools or elsewhere.

Thanks for your time,
