Commenting history:
going through and labling what each file is and/or does
	components - done
	inc - done
	main_dir - working on a-c

Finishing Touches before school starts:
3	Go through code and comment like crazy!
1	"Alert the webmaster" for errors with the site

Brainstorming (add to list with priority number 1-10):
1	Show status of each uniqname when entered in group scheduling and be able to add and remove them
		show number of classes registerd
		show total time in class
1	Add to VIP list from group
1	validate uniqnames for multiview.php
3	show people who have listed you as a VIP
2	sort by columns
4	color code each user or something
5	privacy policy

Bugs:
8	need to deal with time conflicts in schedule
4	need to get weird section data - different times for same section

Features:
6	figure out how to take the difference of times - when I need to do something with it, I will
2	Notification emails for various actions
3	load data from the directory for groups?
4	Get data from Wolverine Access instead of ~regoff?
9	write automated test cases to check code?
	Better logging capabilities - hack attempts
		log all error message - add more debuging info to them
		log ips and session data with error messages
	add more information about users for study groups
		grade
		location - dorm, street, area

Later:
	create-a-class (alternative classes)
	study group creation
