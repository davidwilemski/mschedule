<h1>What is MSchedule?</h1>

<span class="normaltext">
	<br>
	<b>Are you sick of using WolverineAccess to set up your schedule at UofM?</b> We think
	most people agree that WolverineAccess is not
	worth the millions that the University spent on it.  That's why we created MSchedule.
	MSchedule is not only faster for checking the course catalog, but it also has a lot more
	useful features.  And all of this is <b>FREE</b>. Read below to find out just what MSchedule can do for you.
